Made the launcher check if you are connected to the internet before trying to download data from the servers. 
This prevents the launcher from instantly crashing while you are offline.

Changed how the launcher handles downloading files. 
The launcher will now download the .zip files and after it has installed the game/program
it will delete the .zip file to stop all the files from piling up and taking up too much space,
just like my downloads folder lmao.

Fixed an issue that would let you run a game/program even if it was not installed, as this would lead to crashes.
Now the launcher will remove the option to launch a game if it doesn’t detect it.

Added an internal feature that automatically adds new game versions to the data.json file. 
So that if your data.json file is outdated and doesn’t have version data for a game, instead of crashing, it will automatically fix it.
