No update today. 
Currently working on Linux file system compatibility and
internally testing the launcher on Linux.

11/22/21:
Added support for checking changelogs in the launcher.
Each changelog page contains the patches for a specific week.

11/21/21:
Added a base for multiplatform support.
-Multiplatform support will include Windows, MacOSX, and Linux.
-Support for each platform's file system.
-Platform will automatically be detected, and all the files will be for your specific platform.

I have plans for adding a build of WINE, a program to run Windows executables, 
directly into the MacOSX and Linux builds of the launcher.
This would allow them to properly run some of my older projects, 
most of them are built with programs that don’t support building to either of these platforms, 
or I don’t have the source code for them anymore.
